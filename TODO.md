# TODO

- [X] Add ability to map ABC rotational axes
- [ ] Machine limits
- [ ] Input file json schema
- [ ] UI for creating input files to be "sliced", centralize window on viewing wind geo viz
  - Maybe coin the term "layering" or "peeled" or "shelling" to contrast with 3D printer "slicing" an object from bottom up?
